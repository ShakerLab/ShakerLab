We use established and cutting-edge techniques including high throughput sequencing and complementary organoid/organotypic models to identify the role of human esophageal myofibroblasts in benign and malignant esophageal disorders.

## Gastro-esophageal reflux disease (GERD) 

Gastro-esophageal reflux disease (GERD) is a heterogeneous disorder afflicting 30% of the Western World. The pathogenesis of esophageal injury and the progression to pre-malignant Barrettâ€™s esophagus and esophageal adenocarcinoma remain unknown. We are studying the role of the stroma in the regulation of the squamous epithelial response in GERD.

## Esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC)

Esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) is an aggressive and deadly malignancy with 5-year survival less than 25%. Alcohol is a major risk factor for ESCC through incompletely defined mechanisms. Our lab is investigating the effect of alcohol on the esophageal stroma to identify the molecular basis by which alcohol increases risk for esophageal cancer.
