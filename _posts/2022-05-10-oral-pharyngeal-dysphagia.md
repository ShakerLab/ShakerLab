Pharyngeal muscle weakness and dysphagia is common in individuals post-stroke or with Parkinsonâ€™s disease and in individuals with head/neck cancer who have undergone surgery and/or radiation therapy. Therapeutic options for these patients are limited. In collaboration with our Speech Pathology colleagues, this pilot study is intended to assess the feasibility, safety, and efficacy of the External Pharyngeal Exerciser (EPE) on patients with pharyngeal dysphagia receiving swallow therapy. Feasibility will be assessed by patient acceptance and practice records. Safety will be compared between groups to test whether there is an increased risk of the EPE versus standard therapy.

Studies are currently underway. See [ClinicalTrials.gov](https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT05267314).
