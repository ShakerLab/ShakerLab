# About Us

Our lab focuses on delineating the role of epithelial-stromal interactions in regulating injury, repair, inflammation and cancer development in the human esophagus. We use a variety of experimental approaches including traditional cell culture and complementary 3D-organotypic/organoid models to recapitulate esophageal tissue and disease in vitro to understand the  pathways involved. We also use databases and pathology samples to learn more about clinical risk factors for disease and to study the human esophagus in different states: healthy, inflamed or damaged, and with cancer.

Pharyngeal muscle weakness and dysphagia is common in individuals post-stroke or with Parkinsonâ€™s disease and in individuals with head/neck cancer who have undergone surgery and/or radiation therapy. Therapeutic options for these patients are limited. In collaboration with our Speech Pathology colleagues, this pilot study is intended to assess the feasibility, safety, and efficacy of the External Pharyngeal Exerciser (EPE) on patients with pharyngeal dysphagia receiving swallow therapy.
